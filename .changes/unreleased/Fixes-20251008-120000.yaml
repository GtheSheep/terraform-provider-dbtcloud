  Fixed panic crash when attempting to move jobs to environments with insufficient permissions. 
  Added nil pointer checks in job creation, enhanced API error handling for 401/403/404 permission errors,
  and improved error messages to show attempted changes with environment-specific guidance.
  Fixed DELETE 404 handling to treat already-deleted resources as success.
