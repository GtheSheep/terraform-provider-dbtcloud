## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "dbtcloud_databricks_semantic_layer_credential" "sl_cred_databricks_example" {
  configuration = {
    project_id      = var.project_id
    name            = "Databricks SL Credential"
    adapter_version = "databricks_v0"
  }
  credential = {
    project_id                 = var.project_id
    catalog                    = var.catalog 
    token                      = var.token

```shell
# using import blocks (requires Terraform >= 1.5)
import {
  to = dbtcloud_databricks_semantic_layer_credential.example
  id = "credential_id"
}

import {
  to = dbtcloud_databricks_semantic_layer_credential.example
  id = "12345"
}

# using the older import command
terraform import dbtcloud_databricks_semantic_layer_credential.example "credential_id"
terraform import dbtcloud_databricks_semantic_layer_credential.example 12345
